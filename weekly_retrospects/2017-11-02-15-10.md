- Stanislav - following up tasks team have
- Bruno - object detection with Tensorflow model
- Nauris - repo architecture, ROS, object segmentation with ENet
- Gunars - robotic hands
- Daria - learning GIT, learning ROS, documentation on ROS
- Guntis, Didzis - [presentation](/presentations/guntis_slides_20171102.pptx) about virtual environment, decision to go with Gazebo (package in ROS) for the start
- Renars - Showing Virtual Environments

Decided for doing both solution. RL and HardCoded.

Action items as per previous week:

    @Blums, Janis Create  external SLACK room and send invites to all team members - DONE
    @Rodins, Gunars @Blums, Janis to finalise HW procurement + vacuum cleaner – IN PROGRESS request got stuck in it
    @Lashkevich, Daria @Dorbe, Nauris to work on ROS architecture - DONE
    @Dorbe, Nauris to create repository - DONE
    @Rodins, Gunars will work on hydraulic unit - DONE
    @Barzdins, Guntis @Gosko, Didzis @Liepins, Renars will research to find out which virtual environment to use – DONE
    @Opermanis, Bruno @Traskovs, Agris @Dorbe, Nauris will work on apples localisation and actuation instruction (mockup) for laser to point at the centre of apple – IN PROGRESS

There will be no physical meeting on 09/11. We will update one another about progress with tasks in Slack and iterate on one in offline mode if needed.
Since there are two approaches Centralised and Decentralised system architecture and NN training and no unified decision, we will laeve a decision for later, meanwhile do PoC for centralised and starst first modules creation is decentralised
@Nauris Dorbe is allowed to investigate more about possibility to participate in https://challengerocket.com/
New action items

    @Barzdins, Guntis @Gosko, Didzis @Liepins, Renars  - ROS Gazebo based Apple picking simplified game on virtual environement.
    @Opermanis, Bruno @Traskovs, Agris @Lashkevich, Daria – Detection module creation. ROS image input with few components.
